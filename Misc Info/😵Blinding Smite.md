  - Blinding Smite
---
 The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spellâ€™s duration, your weapon flares with a bright light, and the attack deals an extra 3d8 radiant damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends.<br/><br/>
 
  A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.
